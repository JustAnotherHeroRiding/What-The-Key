## Main idea
- Use the Nest.js backend to make an android app
- The data and users will be synchronized between the webapp and the android app
- Users can look up the key and track info on their phones and manage their library on the web/phone
- The look and design will remain the same

## Tech
- Do research on the best practices when it comes to making an app that will use a web backend
- So far it seems that Java/Kotlin with Android studio is the way to go

## Testing
- Figure out how to get the app on my actual phone


## Publish
- Publish the app on the play store
