## Multi platform App

Instead of using Kotlin to create a native android app, let's use React native to create a multi platform app.
We need to implement the same 4 pages with full feature parity


## Navigation
- Navigate between the pages, using the same logos and look from the website

## Home page
- Get random track
- Search spotify tracks
- Add tracks to library

## Library
- See all tracks in the user's library
- Delete the tracks to send them to the recycle bin


## Deleted 
- See all tracks added to the recycle bin
- Restore tracks to library or delete them permanently

## Auth
- Log in and manage the library of tracks using the same database as the website
- Use the supabase tutorial to set up the auth flow [Link](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-expo-react-native)
